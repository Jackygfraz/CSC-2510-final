This is the Official documentation for  Automated Server Configuration, Deployment,
 and Maintenance for Multiple Environments by SwollenHuppo Enterprise

        Instructions:
        1) Open your Managment server and ensure ansible is installed. 
        2) if your ssh key has been set up then clone the following repository 
           (github. git@github.com:Jackygfraz/CSC-2510-final.git). otherwise navigate
           to https://github.com/Jackygfraz/CSC-2510-final to  download and run the
           create_new_ssh_key.sh file. Ensure it has been given proper permissions
           with chmod. 
        3) This new repo contains the file deploy_app.sh which will need to be given 
           proper permissions and then can be run with one input, this input being
           the enviroment type being created. (Dev, Test,or Prod) this script will then
           ask the user for their servers IP addresses so that the hosts file can be 
           properly organized for ansible on any device. it will then
           run the properly given ansible playbook to set up a specific set of servers
