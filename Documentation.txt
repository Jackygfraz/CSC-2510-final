This is the Official documentation for  Automated Server Configuration, Deployment,
 and Maintenance for Multiple Environments by SwollenHuppo Enterprise

        prerequisites:
        1) At least three servers that are A ansible managmement server, a web server and a database server.
             The Ansible Management server must be in linux CentOS7 operating system for this project to
             function properly. This server will also need ansible. The other two should be in debian
             or similar systems. 

        2) git must be installed to the Management server to be able to clone a repository

        3) ssh keys are essential for this to run properly. Therefore they must be set up before
              attempting to run deploy_app.sh which is the primary file in this project. 

        4) To set up a basic ssh key and install the proper applications use this link to github
              (https://github.com/Jackygfraz/CSC-2510-final.git) and download configure_host_server.sh
              or use the same file in the folder given with the project. In order to get the proper 
              ssh key that needs to be added to your personal github this script will print it to the
              terminal to be copied All other essentials will be installed as well. Multiple 
              configurations to 2 diffrent files (ansible.cfg and sshd_config) in etc directory will 
              also be made
        5) Ensure all files are given proper permissions before use with chmod 755 or similar commands.
       

        Instructions:
        1) Open your Managment server and ensure ansible is installed. with ansible --version
        2) Skip this step if the repository is already on your system.
           Assuming your ssh key has been set up, clone the following repository 
           (github. git@github.com:Jackygfraz/CSC-2510-final.git). 
      
        3) This new repo contains the file deploy_app.sh which will need to be given 
           proper permissions and then can be run with one input, this input being
           the enviroment type being created. (Dev, Test,or Prod) this script will then
           ask the user for their servers IP addresses so that the hosts file can be 
           properly organized for ansible on any device. it will then
           run the properly given ansible playbook to set up a specific set of servers



    Error Code List
        1) Code for standard fail case 
        2) Code for an invalid enviroment type being sent to deploy_app.sh
        3) Code for when a bad IP address is entered. deploy_app.sh will print which was entered incorrectly.
