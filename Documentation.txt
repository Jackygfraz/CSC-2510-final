This is the Official documentation for  Automated Server Configuration, Deployment,
 and Maintenance for Multiple Environments by SwollenHuppo Enterprise

        prerequisites:
        1) The Ansible Management server must be in linux CentOS7 operating system for this project to
             function properly. This server will also need ansible.
        2) git must be installed to this same Management server to be able to clone a repository
        3) ssh keys are essential for this to run properly. Therefore they must be set up before
             attempting to run deploy_app.sh. 
        4) To set up a basic ssh key and install the proper applications use this link to github
              ( )
              in order to get the proper ssh key that needs to be added to your personal github
              this script will print it to the terminal to be copied. all other essentials will be 
              installed. Multiple configurations to 2 diffrent files in etc directory will alos be made
          
       

        Instructions:
        1) Open your Managment server and ensure ansible is installed. 
        2) if your ssh key has been set up then clone the following repository 
           (github. git@github.com:Jackygfraz/CSC-2510-final.git). otherwise navigate
           to https://github.com/Jackygfraz/CSC-2510-final to  download and run the
           create_new_ssh_key.sh file. Ensure it has been given proper permissions
           with chmod. 
        3) This new repo contains the file deploy_app.sh which will need to be given 
           proper permissions and then can be run with one input, this input being
           the enviroment type being created. (Dev, Test,or Prod) this script will then
           ask the user for their servers IP addresses so that the hosts file can be 
           properly organized for ansible on any device. it will then
           run the properly given ansible playbook to set up a specific set of servers



    Error Code List
        1) Code for standard fail case 
        2) Code for an invalid enviroment type being sent to deploy_app.sh
        3) Code for when a bad IP address is entered. deploy_app.sh will print which was entered incorrectly.
